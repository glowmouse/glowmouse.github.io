This was pretty much the only picture I got when I was at Starfest this 
year.  The Western Veil nebula is the remnant of a super-nova that exploded 
about 5000 years ago.  I used narrow band imaging to capture the picture, 
mapping Ha to red and Oiii to green and blue.  I wasn’t able to get any 
Sii data because I had an equipment malfunction – one of my filters got 
stuck in its filter drawer.
