The Pelican Nebular is my first and only showable astronomy picture from 2018.
I shot the image on my 11 inch SCT with a Hyperstar and an Atik 490 Camera 
at Starfest, a Southern Ontario Star Party. The image created by stacking 
21 Ha images (green), 29 Oiii images (blue) and 32 Sii images (red).  
All sub-exposures were 2 minutes.

This was my third time controlling the telescope and camera from my 
Raspberry Pi 3 using KStars and Ekos.  I’m hoping to get to a dark sky 
site at least once more time this year.  Until then I’ll be practising 
from my light polluted back deck in mid-town Toronto.
