The Cone Nebula and Christmas Tree Cluster (NGC 2264), my first serious 
attempt at narrow band imaging using my new camera. 23 two minute exposures 
in ha, 20 in oiii, and 19 in sii. Hubble palette.

And the classic Orion Nebula (M42).  I was testing my new camera and narrow 
band filters when I took this picture.  I snapped 3 two minute exposures 
with the Ha filter and 3 two minute exposures with the Oiii filter before 
the clouds rolled in and finished off observing for the night.  The colors 
are mapped so that Red = Ha and Green and Blue = Oiii.

The Antennae Galaxies, NGC 4038 and NGC 4039. The image shows two galaxies 
that are in the process of colliding.  The "Antennae" are actually stars, 
gas, and dust that are being ejected from the galaxies as a result of that 
collision.
