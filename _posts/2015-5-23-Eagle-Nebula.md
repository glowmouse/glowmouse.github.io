M16, the Eagle Nebula. I’m not 100% happy with it, but it’s certainly my 
best Eagle Nebula to date. You can see the Pillers of Creation right in 
the middle. C11 + Hyperstar + Atik 460 Camera, 13 x HA, 9 x OIII, 
16 x Siii, 2 minute exposures

I played around with the palette schemes to make a composite picture.  
The bottom left and upper right quadrants are the classic “hubble” palette.  
In the upper left corner I mapped HA onto red – it would be the closest 
to what the nebula actually looks like… if we could see infra red.  
The blue image in the bottom right is more fanciful.
