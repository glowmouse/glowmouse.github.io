title: North American Nebula (NGC 7000)
---

My attempt at the North America Nebula – you’re looking at Mexico. My 
collimation is off and you can see it if you zoom in on the stars. The 
lesson there is to use a star that’s close to what I’m photographing when 
collimating, and, maybe, to figure out a way to stop the optics from 
shifting while the telescope tracks. My framing is about as good as it’s 
going to get with my camera and scope. It would be nice to include the 
“Florida” part of the nebula, but I’d need to stitch multiple shots 
together. Oh well, I’ll count this one as a learning experience. I made 
this by combining 28 HA exposures (red), 11 SII exposures (green), and 
15 OIII explosures (blue).
